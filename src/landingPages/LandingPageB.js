                <p>
                    Companies use testing to evaluate new features and functionality prior to a general release of
                    their product. Our team has worked hard to develop Meg and ensure she works as designed.
                    Now we want your help to test Meg before she goes on general release.
                </p>
                <h2 className='title-text text-center'>Don’t Worry. No Obligation!</h2>

                    for any reason, just stop. Delete the app, or not. We’d like you to tell us why so we can learn,
                    but you have no obligation to do this.
