                    The National Institutes of Health defines your body mass index, known as your 
                    BMI, as a measure of body fat. It is calculated as your weight divided by the

                <p>
                    Calories are units of energy. We take in food and convert to energy we use to 
                    function and run around. Technically, one calorie (in food use, 1 kilocalorie, 
                    or 1 kcal) is the amount of heat energy to raise the temperature of 1 kilogram 
                    of water by 1 degree Celsius.
