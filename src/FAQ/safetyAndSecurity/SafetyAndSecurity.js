                    If you are being treated for a medical condition, taking prescription medication, 
                    or following a therapeutic diet to treat a disease, it’s especially important to 
                    show the plan you develop with Meg to your health care provider. Any modifications 
                    made to the plan by your health care provider should be followed.

                <h4>Should I use Meg when breastfeeding?</h4>
                <p>
                    Healthy eating is critical while breast feeding, and Meg can help! But please keep 
                    in mind a few important points. First of all, please check with your doctor before 
                    attempting to lose weight while nursing your baby. You want to make sure that you 
                    and the baby are getting enough nourishment. Also, Meg isn’t specifically created 
                    to address questions related to breast feeding, like “should I drink alcohol?” or 
                    “will eating nuts increase the risk of my baby developing a nut allergy?” Questions 
                    like these are best posed to your pediatrician. The good news is that Meg can guide 
                    you regarding healthy eating, and that’s good for your entire family!

                <p>
                    We encourage you to maintain your weight within the healthy weight guidelines 
                    endorsed by the World Health Organization, equivalent to a Body Mass Index (BMI) 
                    between 18.5 and 25.0. You may opt to maintain your current weight while developing 
                    healthy habits. Users with a BMI below 18.5 are not permitted to set a weight loss goal, 
                    as weight loss is not advised for people with BMI below the healthy range.
