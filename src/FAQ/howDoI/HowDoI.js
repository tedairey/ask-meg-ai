                <p>
                    Ready to get started with Meg? There are three steps involved. First, download 
                    the app from the App store. After installing, create an account entering your 
                    username and password. Next tell Meg your name, profile and plan. Then you are all set.
                </p>

            <div className="question">
                <h4>Hear what Meg is saying</h4>
                <p>
                    Please make sure your ringer is set to on. When you mute or silence the ringer, 
                    it mutes Meg and you will only receive responses as text. You can also mute Meg 
                    by tapping the speaker icon.

            <div className="question">
                <h4>Learn about my progress, my weight, my calories, my nutrition, my activity</h4>
                <p>
                    To learn about your progress – with your weight, your nutrition, your calories and 
                    your exercise you can ask Meg by saying “Tell me about my progress” or “Tell me about 
                    my weight”, “Tell me about my nutrition”, “Tell me about my calories” or “Tell me about 
                    my exercise”. You can also tap the analysis icon and see your data as a table and in a 
                    chart for the last few days.
                </p>

                <p>
                    To make an entry into your activity log, you can just tell Meg “I did” followed by the 
                    name of your activity”. So, for example, to log yoga, you’d say “I did a yoga class” and 
                    Meg will help you record the activity. You can also say “I did yoga for 45 minutes this 
                    morning” and Meg will ask you to confirm it.

                    the foods you ate or liquids you drank. Meg will step you through the rest of 
                    the process. Or you can say “I ate steak, fries and a small salad with thousand 
                    island dressing for dinner tonight” and Meg will confirm and log it. Or, you can 
                    scan a food’s UPC code and after Meg has told you about it, say “log it” and 
                    Meg will guide you through the steps to log the food.

                    describe your weight progress. “How am I doing with my nutrition” or “…calories” 
                    or “… exercise” works the same way.

                <h4>Track my calories</h4>
                <p>Meg tracks the calories you consume on an ongoing basis. She also calculates 
                    your calories burned, using your resting metabolic rate (RMR), an allowance for 
                    calories burned through the daily activities of living and the calories you 
                    burn through exercise. Where you burn more calories than you consume, we call 
                    this a calorie deficit. Conversely, where you consume more calories than you 
                    burn, we call this a calorie surplus. You can see your data tapping the analysis icon.

                    Just kidding. After launching the app, Meg is waiting for you question or your 
                    request. At any point, you can say or type Hey Meg or Hi Meg and Meg will be assume 
                    a ready state and be listening for your next sentence. If she doesn’t seem to wake,
