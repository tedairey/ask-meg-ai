                    Meg will help you record the activity. You can also say “I did yoga for 45 minutes this 
                    morning” and Meg will ask you to confirm it.

                    your calories burned, using your resting metabolic rate (RMR), an allowance for 
                    calories burned through the daily activities of living and the calories you 
                    burn through exercise. Where you burn more calories than you consume, we call 
                    this a calorie deficit. Conversely, where you consume more calories than you 
                    burn, we call this a calorie surplus. You can see your data tapping the analysis icon.
