                This Use of Application Agreement ("Agreement") is a legal agreement between you and Tonbridge Health ("Tonbridge Health", "we," "us" or "our"), governing your use of Tonbridge Health’s software application including Meg, weight loss, activity and nutrition analysis programs and our related websites at www.tonbridgehealth.com, www.askmeg.ai and www.askmeg.us (collectively the "Application"). By using the Application, you agree to be bound by this Agreement.
                Both we and you acknowledge that this Agreement is between us and you, and that we are solely responsible for the content of the Application. 
                The privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) covering your use of our Application is described below and incorporated by reference.

                    <strong>Introduction</strong><br/>
                    The Application’s knowledge-base, that’s the information Meg uses to provide you, her Client, with guidance, has been developed by a team comprising faculty at Chicago’s Northwestern Medicine, leading dietitians and exercise physiologists associated with leading professional sports teams. Our team bases their advice on proven weight loss approaches and programs that have strong evidence of demonstrated effectiveness. This advice is supported by health and activity recommendations developed by the U.S. Government’s Centers For Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the National Institutes of Health.  In sum, we avoid “fads” and focus on the proven. Our goal is to provide you with world class advice to help you learn new habits and change old ones. 
                    Meg will provide guidance to promote a healthy weight. However, Meg isn't a doctor and Tonbridge Heath, the organization developing Meg, isn’t a medical organization and we can't give you medical advice. We strongly urge you to consult with your primary health care provider (e.g., physician or nurse practitioner) before starting any plan that could result in weight loss, even if weight loss is not your goal.  
                    We encourage you to maintain your weight within the healthy weight guidelines endorsed by the World Health Organization, equivalent to a Body Mass Index (BMI) between 18.5 and 25.0.  You may opt to maintain your current weight while developing healthy habits. Users with a BMI below 18.5 are not permitted to set a weight loss goal as weight loss is not advised for people with BMI below the healthy range.
                    Weight loss can create physical changes that should be medically monitored. Studies have shown, for example, that weight loss can aggravate gall bladder illness. Medical monitoring is especially important for people with a known medical condition. Our approach encourages a healthier pattern of eating and the development of healthy lifestyle habits. However, it is not intended to treat any illness or disease. 
                    If you are being treated for a medical condition, taking prescription medication, or following a therapeutic diet to treat a disease, it's especially important to show the plan you develop with Meg to your health care provider. Any modifications made to the plan by your health care provider should be followed.
                    If you subscribe to a fee-based product, this Agreement supplements the relevant Subscription Agreement governing your subscription and all such terms and conditions shall continue to apply unless expressly stated below.  
                    We may, at our sole discretion, change, modify, add or remove provisions of this Agreement at any time. By using the Application after we post any changes to this Agreement, you agree to accept those changes, whether or not you have reviewed them. This Agreement will also govern any software upgrades provided by Tonbridge Health.

                <li><strong>Information from Other Sources.</strong><br/>
                We may also supplement the information we collect with information from other sources to assist us in evaluating and improving our Application, to determine your preferences so that we can tailor our Application to your needs, or to study nutritional, weight-loss, behavioral and fitness questions in general.

                    <strong>The information we collect.</strong><br/>
                    The following is a description of the primary ways we collect information about you.
                    <br/>
                    <em className='terms-italics'>Becoming a Registered User.</em>
                    <br/>
                    In order to access certain services, such as conversing with Meg, using our weight-loss and nutritional services, you must first complete certain steps to become a registered user or subscriber. During these steps, you may be required to provide us with information (including Personally Identifiable Information) such as name, zip code, email address, phone number, date of birth and, if you subscribe to one of our Online Services, payment and billing information. This information is used to help us understand who uses our Online Services, to contact users about requested Online Services or for subscription billing purposes. 
                    Tracking Technologies.
                    Tonbridge Health uses cookies and similar technologies to analyze trends and administer our services. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual as well as aggregated basis.  Users can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level. 
                    <br/>
                    <em className='terms-italics'>Social Media (Features) and Widgets</em>
                    <br/>
                    Our Online Services includes social media features, buttons and widgets provided by third party social media platforms (collectively, the "Features"). A Feature may set a cookie to enable the Feature to function properly. 
                    <br/>
                    <em className='terms-italics'>Testimonials</em>
                    <br/>
                    We may display personal testimonials of satisfied customers on our site in addition to other endorsements.  With your consent we may post your testimonial along with your name.  If you wish to delete your testimonial from our Website, you can contact us at support@askmeg.ai. 
                    Linking your account with third party applications and devices
                    We may offer you the option to connect your Application account with third party applications or devices (each a "Tracker") such as activity trackers that measure your activity level (e.g. the number of steps and distance walked, calories burned and other personal metrics). 
                    <br/>
                    <em className='terms-italics'>Referral Programs</em>
                    <br/>
                    Through third party referral program operators and others, we offer referral programs whereby referral websites can earn commissions through the referral of subscribers or other purchasers to our Website. To track the earning of such commissions, and to determine the effectiveness of the referral programs, the users who become subscribers to our Online Services or purchasers through such referral websites are tracked using technologies that do not include Personally Identifiable Information (such as cookies). Our program operators and the referral websites themselves can only access information such as data relating to the number of impressions served, the number of transactions completed, and their resulting earnings. They cannot access our customers' personal data.
                    If you choose to apply to be a referral website, we use the data you provide strictly for conducting business with you. We have entered into certain agreements with third party program operators for the purpose of administering our referral programs. Should you become a referral website of ours through one of our third-party program operators, any information you provide to them is subject to their privacy policies.
                    Public Forums and the Public Profile Feature
                    We feature public forums such as those contained in the community areas where you and other users of our Application can communicate with one another. In addition, we permit you to share information about yourself (including, if you elect, Personally Identifiable Information) with others.
                    THIS PRIVACY POLICY DOES NOT PROTECT YOU WHEN YOU USE OUR PUBLIC FORUMS OR PROVIDE INFORMATION (INCLUDING PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION) ABOUT YOURSELF THROUGH THE PUBLIC PROFILE FEATURE OR THROUGH ANY COMMUNITY IN OUR APPLICATION. 
                    You should be aware that any information shared in a public forum such as a message board, blog, personal page, posting, group, bulletin board or recipe swap or through our Public Profile feature is public information and may be seen or collected by third parties that do not adhere to our Privacy Policy, although the availability of personal pages or groups identified as "private" may be limited to certain permitted users. However, even information marked "private" may be viewed by our staff. You should think carefully before disclosing any information in any public forum, or through the Public Profile feature, on our Website. For example, you should not select a username that includes personally identifiable information. To request removal of your personally identifiable information from our Community, contact our Privacy Coordinator at the address indicated below.
                    <br/>
                    <em className='terms-italics'>Log Files</em>
                    <br/>
                    As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically. This information may include Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser types, domain names, and other anonymous statistical data involving the use of our Application. This information may be used to analyze trends, to administer the Website, to monitor our Application's use, and to gather general demographic information. 
                    <br/>
                    <em className='terms-italics'>Refer A Friend</em>
                    <br/>
                    Through our referral tools for informing a friend about our Application, we will automatically send your friend a one-time communication containing the information you request to be sent. If you elect to use these referral tools, we will collect from you certain Personally Identifiable Information about your friend such as your friend's name and email address. Your friend may contact us at support@askmeg.ai to request that we remove this information from our database.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Children</strong><br/>
                We are committed to protecting the privacy of children. Our Application is not designed for or directed to children under the age of 13. We do not collect Personally Identifiable Information from any person we actually know is under the age of 13. We urge all parents or guardians to participate in their children's exploration of the Internet, and to teach their children about protecting their personally identifiable information while online.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Use of Information</strong><br/>
                In general, we use the information collected through our Application to help us understand who uses our Application and how it is used, to personalize your experience, to assist you in using our Application, to improve our Application, and for subscription billing purposes, if applicable. 
                Except as set forth in this Privacy Policy or as specifically agreed to by you, we will not disclose any information we gather from you on our Website.
                We may disclose your information (including Personally Identifiable Information) if we believe in good faith that we are required to do so in order to comply with an applicable statute, regulation, rule or law, a subpoena, a search warrant, a court or regulatory order, or other valid legal process. We may disclose Personally Identifiable Information in special circumstances when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating our Use Agreement or to protect the safety or security of our users, our Application or the general public.
                We may provide to third parties information about you that does not allow you to be identified or contacted, including where such information is combined with similar information of other users of our Application. For example, we might inform third parties regarding the number of unique users who visit our Application, the demographic breakdown of the registered users of our Application, or the activities that visitors to our Application engage in while using our Application. The third parties to which we may provide this information may include potential or actual advertisers, providers of advertising services, commercial partners, sponsors, licensees, researchers and other similar parties.
                We may employ independent contractors, vendors and suppliers (collectively, "Outside Contractors") to provide specific services such as developing applications. These Outside Contractors may sometimes have limited access to information collected on our Website, including your Personally Identifiable Information, in the course of providing Services or services to us. Access to your Personally Identifiable Information by these contractors is limited to the information reasonably necessary in order for the Outside Contractors to perform their limited function for us. We also require that these Outside Contractors (i) protect the privacy of your Personally Identifiable Information consistent with this Privacy Policy, and (ii) not use or disclose your Personally Identifiable Information for any purpose other than providing us with Services or services for which we contracted.
                We reserve the right to transfer information to a third party in the event of a sale, merger or other transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of Tonbridge health or in the case of bankruptcy, provided that the third party agrees to adhere to the terms of this Privacy Policy. We will notify users of any such transfer through notice on our site and through email.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Security</strong><br/>
                We want your information (including Personally Identifiable Information) to remain as secure as possible. We strive to provide secure transmission of your information from your computer to our servers through industry-standard techniques. We secure the Personally Identifiable Information you provide on servers located in secure cloud environments, protected from unauthorized access, use, or alteration. Only employees who need access to your information to perform a specific task or function are granted access to such information. In addition, all of our employees must abide by this Privacy Policy and are kept up-to-date on security practices. 
                Notwithstanding the above commitments to protect your information (including Personally Identifiable Information) from loss, misuse or alteration by third parties, you should be aware that there is always some risk involved in transmitting information over the Internet. There is also some risk that others could find a way to thwart our security systems. As a result, while we strive to protect your information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security and privacy of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk.
                Except as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy, we will only use Personally Identifiable Information for the purposes described above or as otherwise disclosed at the time we request such information from you. 
                </li>
                <li><strong>Updating Your Information</strong><br/>
                Upon request, we will provide you with information about whether we hold any of your personal information. You can always contact us in order to (1) update or correct your Personally Identifiable Information, (2) change your preferences with respect to communications and other information you receive from us, or (3) delete the Personally Identifiable Information maintained about you on our systems, by talking to Meg. Such updates, corrections, changes and deletions will not have an effect on other information that we maintain, or information that we have provided to third parties in accordance with this Privacy Policy prior to such update, correction, change or deletion.
                You should be aware that it is not technologically possible to remove each and every record of the information you have provided to us from our systems. The need to back-up our systems to protect information from inadvertent loss means that a copy of your Personally Identifiable Information may exist in a non-erasable form that will be difficult or impossible for us to locate. We promise that promptly after receiving your request, all Personally Identifiable Information stored in databases we actively use and other readily searchable media will be updated, corrected, changed or deleted, as appropriate. We will respond to your request promptly.
                We retain your information for various purposes as allowed by law, including to ensure that we can continue to provide our services to you as requested, that we respect your opt-out wishes into the future and that we can comply with our legal obligations. 
                </li>
                <li><strong>Updates To This Policy</strong><br/>
                If we change this Privacy Policy, we will post those changes on our Application so you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use Personally Identifiable Information in a manner significantly different from that stated in this Privacy Policy, or otherwise disclosed to you, at the time it was collected, we will notify you, and you will have a choice as to whether or not we use your Personally Identifiable Information in the new manner. We may also make non-significant changes to our Privacy Policy that generally will not affect our use of your Personally Identifiable Information. If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, you should not use our Application.
